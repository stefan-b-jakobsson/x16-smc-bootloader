# Purpose

This project provides a custom bootloader for the Commander X16's ATtiny861-based System Management Controller (SMC). 

The bootloader enables updating the SMC firmware directly from the Commander X16 without an external programmer.


# How It Works

## Firmware Update Process

### Starting the Update Process

The firmware update process can be initiated in one of two ways:

1. Normal Update: By requesting the firmware to call the bootloaderâ€™s start update function (address 0x1e02).

2. Recovery Update: By holding down the Reset button while powering on the computer.

### Transmission Details

A firmware update program running on the Commander X16 transmits the new SMC firmware to the bootloader via I2C. 
The bootloader checks the integrity of the data and writes it to the SMC's flash memory.

The transmission is divided into packets of nine bytes. A packet begins with
eight firmware bytes. The last byte is a checksum. I2C command 
offset 0x80 is used to transmit each byte of a packet.

A complete packet must be committed using I2C command offset 0x81 before transmission
of the next packet is started.

The update process continues by transmitting and committing packets until the whole
firmware has been received by the bootloader.

The update program running on the X16 can optionally rewind the target address
to 0x0000 using command 0x84 and use command 0x85 to read one byte at a time from
the SMC flash memory. This can be used to verify the update.

Finally, the update program must use command 0x82 to reset the SMC. This will
write any remaining buffered data to flash memory and then turn off the computer.

### Flash Pages, Special Actions when Updating the First Page

The SMC can only update the flash memory in whole pages of 64 bytes. The committed
packets are buffered until there is a full page that can be written to flash memory.

On receiving the first full page (address 0x0000-0x003f), the bootloader takes
these special actions:

- Erasing the firmware area of the flash memory (address 0x0000-0x1dff)

- Moving the firmware's reset vector (address 0x0000) to EE_RDY (address 0x0012)

- Pointing the reset vector to the bootloader main vector (address 0x1e00)

The reason for this is explained in the SMC reset process below.


## SMC Reset Process

The SMC is reset when first connecting it to power or when 
the reset pin (#10) is grounded. On reset, execution starts from the reset 
vector (address 0x0000).

When the bootloader is installed, the reset vector is set to always jump to 
the bootloader main function (address 0x1e00).

The bootloader main function checks if the Reset button is being pressed.

If the Reset button is not pressed, the bootloader jumps to
the EE_RDY vector (address 0x0012). The firmware's original
reset vector is moved here during the update process. Jumping to
EE_RDY thus starts the firmware and continues normal operation.

If the button is pressed, the computer is powered on and the 
recovery update process is started. The computer has no keyboard
support during the recovery update. The update program that runs
on the X16 is typically stored as AUTOBOOT.X16 so that it
autoloads and runs when powering on the system. The update program
must also be able to carry out the update without
interaction from the user.


## Fail-Safe

The bootloader was designed to be fail-safe. In many
cases the bootloader recovery update process can be started even if 
the firmware is inoperable (bricked).

The fail-safe was designed especially with these situations in mind:

1. Update process interrupted during the firmware erase stage: Firmware
erase starts from the last page. If interrupted during this stage,
the reset vector at address 0x0000 is still unchanged, and a
recovery update is possible.

2. Update process interrupted after the whole firmware has been erased but
before writing any parts of the new firmware to flash memory: When
erasing the flash memory all words are set to byte value 0xffff, 
which is interpreted as No Operation (NOP) by the SMC hardware. Execution
starts from the reset vector at 0x0000 and continues until
the first non NOP instruction at 0x1e00, the bootloader main function.
This makes it possible to start the recovery update in this situation.

3. Update process interrupted after writing parts of the new
firmware to flash memory: The first page written to flash memory
holds the reset vector that jumps to the bootloader main function making
it possible to start the recovery update.

# Building the Project

Type ```make``` to build the bootloader.

Build dependencies:

- make

- AVRA assembler https://github.com/Ro5bert/avra

- Python 3

- Python intelhex module, install with pip intelhex

The bootloader is also automatically built by a Github action.


# Fuse Settings

The bootloader and the SMC firmware depend on several ATtiny fuse settings as set out below.

The recommended low fuse value is 0xF1. This will run the SMC at 16 MHz.

The recommended high fuse value is 0xD4. This enables Brown-out Detection at 4.3V, which is necessary to prevent flash memory corruption when self-programming is enabled. Serial Programming should be enabled (bit 5) and external reset disable should not be selected (bit 7). These settings are necessary for programming the SMC with an external programmer.

Finally, the extended fuse value must be 0xFE to enable self-programming of the flash memory. The bootloader cannot work without this setting.


# Initial Programming of the SMC with Avrdude

The initial programming of the SMC is done with an external programmer.

The command line utility avrdude is the recommended tool together
with a programmer that is compatible with avrdude.

Example 1. Set fuses
```
avrdude -cstk500v1 -Cavrdude.conf -pattiny861 -P<your port> -b19200 -Ulfuse:w:0xF1:m -Uhfuse:w:0xD4:m -Uefuse:w:0xFE:m
```

Example 2. Write to flash
```
avrdude -cstk500v1 -Cavrdude.conf -pattiny861 -P<your port> -b19200 -Uflash:w:build/firmware_with_bootloader.hex:i
```

The -c option selects programmer-id; stk500v1 is for using Arduino UNO as an In-System Programmer. If you have another ISP programmer, you may need to change this value accordingly.

The -p option selects the target device, always attiny861.

The -P option selects port name on the host computer.

The -b option sets transmission baudrate; 19200 is a good value.

The -U option performs a memory operation. "-U flash:w:filename:i" writes to flash memory. "-U lfuse:w:0xF1:m" writes the low fuse value.

Please note that some fuse settings may cause the ATtiny861 not to respond. Resetting might require equipment for high voltage programming. Be careful if you choose not to use the recommended values.

The Arduino IDE also uses avrdude in the background. If you have installed the IDE you may enable verbose output and see what parameters are used by the IDE when it starts avrdude.


# I2C API

## Command 0x80 = Transmit (master write)

The transmit command is used to send a data packet to the bootloader.

A packet consists of 8 bytes to be written to flash and 1 checksum byte.

The checksum is the two's complement of the least significant byte of the sum of the previous bytes in the packet. The least significant byte of the sum of all 9 bytes in a packet will consequently always be 0.

## Command 0x81 = Commit (master read)

After a data packet of 9 bytes has been transmitted it must be committed with this command. 

The first commit will target flash memory address 0x0000. The target address is moved forward 8 bytes on each successful commit.

The command returns 1 byte. The possible return values are:

Value | Description
------|-------------
1     | OK
2     | Error, packet size not 9
3     | Checksum error
4     | Reserved
5     | Error, overwriting bootloader section

The firmware flash memory is erased on the 8th successful commit, just before writing the first 64 bytes to flash memory.

## Command 0x82 = Reboot (master write)

The reboot command must always be called after the last packet
has been committed. If not, the SMC may be left in an inoperable
state.

The command first writes any buffered data to flash.

The bootloader then resets the SMC. The SMC reset shuts down the computer. It
can be restarted by pressing the power button. It is not necessary to power cycle the system
after an update.

## Command 0x83 = Get bootloader version (master read)

This command returns the bootloader version.

Available since bootloader v3.

## Command 0x84 = Rewind target address (master write)

Rewinds the target address to 0.

Available since bootloader v3.

## Command 0x85 = Read flash memory

Reads one byte of flash memory at the current target address.

The target address is post-incremented one byte.

This function is primarily intended to be used for verifying the
content of the flash memory after an update.

Available since bootloader v3.
